  PCRE LICENCE
  ------------

  PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
  and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

  Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the &quot;BSD&quot; licence, as
  specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the &quot;doc&quot;
  directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
  in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

  The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
  included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
  just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
  are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.
